# Internxt CLI WebDav support

The Internxt CLI comes with built in WebDav support.

## How it works

When you login with Internxt CLI, your auth tokens and your decrypted mnemonic are stored in your local home folder. These data will be used for both the CLI and WebDAV. Restarting the computer or uninstalling the CLI will not erase this configuration. The only way to properly clean up this configuration is by explicitly using the logout command or by removing the '.internxt-cli' folder located in your home directory.

The WebDav feature works by exposing a local only server in your machine when enabled.

- When you download a file, the WebDav local server decrypts your data and sends it to the WebDav client
- When you upload a file, the WebDav local server encrypts your data and sends it to the Internxt servers

No plain data is being sent or is being pulled from the Internxt servers, you can view the whole Internxt CLI + WebDav architecture in the below diagram.

_We currently have a 20GB size upload limitation per file for both, CLI and WebDAV_

## Requisites

- Installed Node >= v20.0.0
- Internxt CLI is installed on its latest version

## Usage

- Log into your account with `internxt login`
- Enable WebDav with `internxt webdav enable`
- Access your files via WebDAV with any of our supported clients by using https://webdav.local.internxt.com:3005 or https://127.0.0.1:3005
- Disable WebDav with `internxt webdav disable`

## Known issues

- We use self-signed certificates when using HTTPS. This ensures that all requests to the local WebDAV server are encrypted. However, since the certificates are self-signed, many WebDAV clients may show warnings about certificate trust. You can safely ignore these warnings.

- You may encounter issues with DNS resolution for webdav.local.internxt.com. In such cases, you can safely replace this address with 127.0.0.1 or the IP address where the WebDAV server is deployed if connecting from a different location.
